To fix the issue, avoid using `@apply` inside responsive modifiers.  A cleaner approach is to directly apply classes or use a more structured approach to your responsive design.  Here's a corrected example:

```html
<div class="md:bg-red-500 md:text-white lg:bg-blue-500 lg:text-black">
  <p>
     This text should be white on md screens and black on lg screens.
  </p>
</div>
```

This version directly applies the background and text colors for each breakpoint, eliminating the potential conflict and ensuring consistent results.  This approach provides greater clarity and predictability in your CSS.
