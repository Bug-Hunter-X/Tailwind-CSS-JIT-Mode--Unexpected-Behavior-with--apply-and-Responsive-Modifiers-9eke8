The Tailwind CSS JIT mode can produce unexpected behavior when dealing with complex responsive design systems.  For example, using `@apply` directives within responsive modifiers can lead to styles not applying as expected or conflicting with other styles. Consider this example:

```html
<div class="md:bg-red-500 lg:bg-blue-500">
  <p class="@apply md:text-white lg:text-black">
     This text should be white on md screens and black on lg screens.
  </p>
</div>
```

This *might* not work as expected due to the interplay of `@apply` and the responsive modifiers. JIT mode's order of operations can cause unexpected overrides.
